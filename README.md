# mycotoxin_prediction
This project uses hyperspectral data to predict vomitoxin (DON) concentration in corn samples.
# setup instructions
1. Clone the repository:
  ```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mycotoxin-prediction.git
cd mycotoxin-prediction
```
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```
3. Install dependencies:

``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Running the Code

1. Open Jupyter Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook ImagoAI_Assignment.ipynb
```
2. Execute the cells in order to perform data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
